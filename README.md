# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
Registered users will have the ability to create, update, and delete their own links as they see fit. However, users can share 
the link through a /u/:link format to anyone and they will be redirected to its corresponding website. TinyApp for now is 
run through localhost at *PORT: 8080*. TinyApp common error handling is done through an alert system as shown below in the 
last screenshot. TinyApp uses **bcrypt** to hash the passwords and **cookie-session** for cookie encryption to give the user 
a secure and comfortable time while creating a short URL.
